## Quote for today: 
Not fast
slowly
don't rush 
never mind the outside 

It's not a quote per se but I was fascilitating a  Digital transformation class yesterday, and I was assigned an old man in his 60s. 
He had multiple devices icluding an old 4GB laptop which we stuggled to get power bi working on.So while I was fighting 
to make it work, he would tell me to go slow whenever he saw I was anxious. 'Slowly! Slowly! it's okay, I am nevermind' he would say, and this was an opening moment for me
because I am always in a rush to do something new, to move to the next new thing. But spenging the 2 hours trying to explain to him how to download csv, and upload it to power bi has taught me to relax, and take it one step at a time haha.
