## Quote for today: Consistency beats talent -- I have no idea where this comes from
## Objective: 
- write a code that a can calculate the tip that has to be split between friends. 
## Lessons
subscripting and type scripting 
- I didn't know you can access charectors of a string without assigning a variable to it- Type() function -> checks the data tupe for us, I knew this but just putting it out there just heheh. 
- Type casting -> changing data type from one form to another 
## Reflections

- I am so sleepy today hahah, but had to get this done before I sleep and it feels great to have one task done. 

## Conclusion 

Small small.....
