# 100daysofcode
 Day 1
 date 15 Jan 2022
## Quote for today: A journey of 100 miles begins with a single step. --william's version
## Objective: 
- write a simple python code that gets inputs from the command line and use it to produce band names 
## Lessons
- I learned to use python's input function 
- honestly I didn't know right from the top of my head which function to use to get user input from user. 

## Reflections

- Every now and then I find myself searching how to write code and I think one of my weaknesses is poor basic python skills. I learned to program by trying to solve problesm that usually required me to use complex concepts like OOP and so I ended up not covering the basics. Now I find myself searching for the simplest of functions that I should know right from the top of my head such as the input, hahah. But yeah, having to go through python basics and polishing my foundation is a great step and putting this in public is just a way to share with everyone and to encourage people who want to start learning how to program and are considering how to use python as their entry language. 

## Conclusion 

This is the end of my day1, and I expect to have fun with this 100 day project.
