# 100daysofcode
Update for Day 9 date 15 JAN 2023 
## Quote for today/message: 
I've always wanted to create a few endpoints that I can use in my own personal life,
and at work. This time I created a QR code generator endpoint. Hopefully in the future 
I will deploy it to some cloud environment and be able to create my own QR codes without 
going through the websites full of adverts. 
## Objective: 

QR code genrator on FastAPI

## Lessons
Nothing much 
## Reflections
Makefile are pretty usefull when you don't want to remember to command to start up your server
## Conclusion 
Great refresher
